# Airplane-Ticket-Booking-App



This repository contains the code for our 3-1 project, 
developed by me and my teammate asef sami, using the Flutter framework to build our app. 
This is a booking airline ticket app where users can easily browse flights, book tickets, and manage their reservations seamlessly.
